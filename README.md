# Coffee-Timer
A timer for people with ADHD. Coffee is acidic, and denatures both amphetamine and methylphenidate. This timer aims to provide an easy-to-use resource for timing when to have a coffee after taking stimulant ADHD medication. 

How to use:
Run in Visual Studio or from the command line. When prompted, close the window that appears to start the timer.
